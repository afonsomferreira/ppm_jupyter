    "### First, what is Anaconda? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a desktop GUI (Graphical User Interface) that makes it easy to launch applications and manage packages and environments without using command-line commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as kind of Microsoft Office. Instead of having to download Powerpoint, Excel, Word separately, Microsoft Office offers all applications together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is it free? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Although you have premium versions for companies that offer more services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where can I download it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here for all options: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the quick link for Windows: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Windows-x86_64.exe\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the quick link for Mac: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg\n",
    "\n",
    "### What now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can follow the instructions in the link until you finish the instalation: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Anaconda work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open it, you will have several applications there.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/_images/nav-defaults.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just click on one of the applications (Spyder or Pycharm for Python | RStudio for R | Jupyter Notebook for Interactive Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I repeat the exercises done in Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just open the Jupyter Notebook app in Anaconda by clicking on it.\n",

    "![Jupyter Notebook](https://i.ibb.co/T47yZKj/anaconda.png)\n",
    "\n",
